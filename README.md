# Recovery Code

This is a set of code the CalSTAR's recovery team will use for calculation and automation of design decision and verification from OpenRocket files.

## Spectre_V6.ork
The current iteration of the IREC 2019 launch vehicle design in open rocket (as of 2018-11-16)

## parachutes.py
This file takes in an ORK file and outputs relevant information for common parachute sizes.

## read_ork.py
This file consists of playing around with XML parsing of OpenRocket files and shouldn't be used for productive coding. Pls ignore.

## Dependencies
Not sure, will add later

## Usage
